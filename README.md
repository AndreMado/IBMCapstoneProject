# IBM Capstone Project

This is the IBM Capstone Project, where I'll use all the technologies that I have learned throughout all the IBM courses to become a Data Engineer. You will find a complete hypothetical scenario that demonstrates the tasks and challenges a Data Engineer faces in their daily work.

## 📌 Environment
This document introduces you to the data platform architecture of an eCommerce company named **SoftCart**.

SoftCart uses a **hybrid architecture**, with some of its databases on-premises and others in the cloud.

## 📌 Tools and Technologies
- **OLTP database:** MySQL
- **NoSQL database:** MongoDB
- **Production Data Warehouse:** IBM DB2 on Cloud
- **Staging Data Warehouse:** PostgreSQL
- **Big Data Platform:** Hadoop
- **Big Data Analytics:** Apache Spark
- **Business Intelligence Dashboard:** IBM Cognos Analytics
- **Data Pipelines:** Apache Airflow

## 📌 Data Processing Workflow

1. **SoftCart's website** serves customers through multiple devices like laptops, mobiles, and tablets.
2. **Product catalog data** is stored in **MongoDB**.
3. **Transactional data (inventory & sales)** is stored in **MySQL**.
4. The **web server** interacts with these two databases.
5. Data is periodically **extracted from MySQL & MongoDB** and loaded into a **PostgreSQL staging data warehouse**.
6. The **production data warehouse** is hosted on **IBM DB2 Cloud**.
7. **BI teams** use IBM DB2 for dashboard creation via **IBM Cognos Analytics**.
8. A **Hadoop cluster** collects all data for **big data analytics**.
9. **Apache Spark** analyzes data stored in Hadoop.
10. **Apache Airflow** manages ETL pipelines for data movement between all components.

# 🚀 Steps to Run the Project

## **1️⃣ Deploying Services Using setup.sh (Recommended)**
The `setup.sh` script automates the deployment of all necessary services in Minikube, including:
- **MySQL and phpMyAdmin**
- **MongoDB**
- **PostgreSQL and pgAdmin**
- **Downloading required datasets**
- **Executing initial SQL scripts**

### **Run the script:**
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### **What the script does:**
1. Starts **Minikube** (if not already running).
2. Deploys **MySQL** and **phpMyAdmin**.
3. Deploys **MongoDB**.
4. Deploys **PostgreSQL** and **pgAdmin**.
5. Waits for all services to be up and running.
6. Imports necessary datasets and executes SQL scripts automatically.

---

## **2️⃣ Accessing phpMyAdmin**
After running `setup.sh`, you can access phpMyAdmin using:

1. Get Minikube's IP:
```bash
minikube ip
```
2. Open the following URL in your browser:
```
http://<MINIKUBE_IP>:30001
```

### **Login Credentials**
- **Username:** `root`
- **Password:** (stored in Kubernetes Secret, default: `rootpassword`)

---

## **3️⃣ Accessing MongoDB in Minikube**

### **1. Open MongoDB shell**
```bash
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -l app=mongodb -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}") -- mongosh -u mongoadmin -p securepass --authenticationDatabase admin
```

### **2. Verify the imported data**
```javascript
use electronics
db.electronics.find().limit(5).pretty()
```

### **3. Retrieve MongoDB credentials from Kubernetes Secret**
```bash
kubectl get secret mongodb-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD}" | base64 --decode
```

---

## **4️⃣ Connecting pgAdmin to PostgreSQL in Minikube**

### **1. Retrieve PostgreSQL Service IP**
```bash
kubectl get svc postgres-service
```
📌 **Use the `CLUSTER-IP` instead of a dynamic pod IP for stable connections.**

### **2. Access pgAdmin**
```bash
minikube service pgadmin-service --url
```
Login with:
- **Email:** `pgadmin@example.com`
- **Password:** `securepass`

### **3. Add a New Server in pgAdmin**
1. In **pgAdmin**, right-click on **"Servers"** → **"Create" → "Server"**.
2. **General Tab** → Set **Name**: `PostgreSQL Minikube`.
3. **Connection Tab**:
   - **Host name/address:** `postgres-service` (or `CLUSTER-IP` from step 1).
   - **Port:** `5432`
   - **Maintenance database:** `staging`
   - **Username:** `admin`
   - **Password:** `securepass` (must be entered manually).
   - **Click "Save"**.

### **4. Verify the Connection**
If successful, expand **Databases → staging** in **pgAdmin**.  
If issues arise, check:
```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=postgres
kubectl get svc postgres-service
kubectl logs -l app=postgres
```

## **5. Exercises of PostgreSQL**
1- To complete the exercises in the module number 3 is necessary run some sql staments, you con find it inside the sql directory.
2.- By coping the query's individually you can take the screenshots for the tasks, (those statemnts are in exercises.sql)

## **6. Module 5 of the CapstoneProject ##
1.-You must drop the table sales_data from mysql to run the new sales.sql script, you can use either way using UI or terminal to do it.
2.-To run the python script named "mysqlconnect.py" locate in python directory you must create a python virtual enviroment to install all the requiered dependencies.
```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # En Linux/macOS
myenv\Scripts\activate     # En Windows (CMD)
pip install mysql-connector-python
```
3.- Configure the script with the NodePort IP of the mysql in Kubernetes.
```bash
kubectl get svc mysql-service
```
4.- The configuration should be as follows:
```javascript
connection = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='pass',host='192.168.49.2', port=30007,database='sales')
```
## - MySQL to PostgreSQL Synchronization

In this module, we implemented a **data synchronization system** between the **MySQL OLTP database** and the **PostgreSQL Data Warehouse**. 

## IMPORTANT YOU MUST CREATE AND LOAD THE DATA MANUALLY IN BOTH DATABASES, MYSQL AND POSTGRES AS LAB INSTRUCTIONS.
### 5Module Key Features: (automation.py)
- **`get_latest_records()`**: Retrieves all new records from MySQL that are not yet present in PostgreSQL.
- **`insert_records()`**: Inserts new records into PostgreSQL while preventing duplicates.
- **Python Automation**: The entire synchronization process is automated through a Python script.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures robust database operations with proper exception management.

This synchronization guarantees that the Data Warehouse remains **up-to-date with the latest transactions** from the OLTP database. 🚀

## **Apache Airflow Deployment and Configuration** 🚀  

### **Overview**  
In this module, we successfully deployed **Apache Airflow** on Kubernetes using Minikube. Airflow serves as the **ETL orchestration tool** that automates data workflows across different systems.  

### **Implementation Steps**  

### 🏗 **1. Deployment on Kubernetes**  
- Airflow was deployed using a Kubernetes **Deployment and Service** definition.  
- A **Persistent Volume** was configured to store DAGs.  
- The Web UI was exposed via a **NodePort service** to allow external access.  

### 🗄 **2. Database Configuration**  
- Instead of deploying a separate database, **Airflow was integrated with the existing PostgreSQL instance** used for the Data Warehouse.  
- The `SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN` parameter was set in `airflow-deployment.yaml` to connect Airflow to PostgreSQL.  
- Airflow’s metadata database was **initialized within PostgreSQL** to ensure persistence across pod restarts.  

### 🔐 **3. Secrets Management**  
- A **Kubernetes Secret** was created to store Airflow's authentication credentials securely.  
- The credentials were injected into the **Airflow environment variables** for secure login management.  

### 🔑 **4. User Authentication and UI Access**  
- The Airflow Web UI was configured with **RBAC authentication**.  
- The first admin user was created manually inside the Airflow container to enable secure access.  

### 🛠 **5. Testing and Troubleshooting**  
- Logs were monitored to resolve **connection issues between Airflow and PostgreSQL**.  
- The database credentials were validated using direct **psql commands** inside the PostgreSQL pod.  
- Several **deployment rollouts and pod restarts** were performed to ensure the correct environment setup.  

### ✅ **Current Status**  
- Airflow is **fully operational** and connected to PostgreSQL.  
- The Web UI is accessible using secure credentials.  
- The system is now ready for **DAG development** and task automation.  
- You may have problems with Auth access in Airflow, if the user do not exist you must create inside la instance of airflow, how?
```bash
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -l app=airflow -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}") -- bash
#ONCE INSIDE, VERIFY THE USERS BY TYPING
airflow users list 
#VERIFY THE PERSISTENT DB TOO, IN THIS CASE, POSTGRES
airflow config get-value core sql_alchemy_conn
#CREATE THE USER IF NOT EXISTS(YOU CAN CHANGE THE VALUES AS YOU WANT).
airflow users create --username admin --password admin --firstname Admin --lastname User --role Admin --email admin@example.com
```
